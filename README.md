# Social Media Simulator

Source code of [Social Media Simulator](https://www.roblox.com/games/14844187553).

Social Media Simulator is an RPG game with over 30k plays and a current like ratio of 85%.

It has been developed in Lua using the Roblox Studio game engine.


# Status

The project has reached a stable stage with multiple updates to add content and fix bugs but is not being actively developed anymore.


# Project

I worked on this as a side project for about 6 months. I learnt Lua by myself by working on other projects before this one.

As a solo developer on the project, I had to work on all aspects of the game: coding, UI designing, modeling, testing, fixing bugs... which allowed me to learn and improve a lot.

Since then, I have started working on a new project in C# that you can find [here](https://github.com/Quentin-Chauvelon/3D-Ball-Maze)
